# statistics-r
Statistical inference project in R

The idea for this project came from a course that I completed where I had to perform statistical inference on the General Social Survey data for the final assignment. I found this task really interesting so I decided to further investigate the data by asking more questions and using different statistical methods.

The whole project can be read in the stat_project.html file which contains explanations and diagrams, as well as the code itself.
